# InformationButtonTester
A Toy app that tests an information button that uses a base64 encoded rtf file for the document and allows working hyperlinks.

The default text holds an example of an RTF file that doesn't work due to the way that the hyperlink was encoded.  The import button can be used to load other documents such as the Sample Good Link.rtf that is known to work.

This was created in Visual Studio 2017
